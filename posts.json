		"body":"<p>I have just returned to London from a visit to La Biennale di Venezia, which opened last month. This is an energizing and paradigm-breaking show: 90% of the artists are women, with a majority of gender non-binary subjects. But strikingly, neither the Biennale President, Roberto Cicutto, nor curator Cecilia Alemani devote any space in the program guide to questions of nation-based culture and identity. And yet since its inception in 1887, the Venice biennale, building upon the tradition of World Fairs, has adhered to nation-based organization. Nations were invited to build their own, permanent pavilions or 'houses of art,' beginning with Belgium (1907), Hungary (1909), Bavaria (1909, which became Germania in 1912), Great Britain (1909), France (1912), Netherlands (1914), Russia (1914), Spain (1922), Czechoslovakia (1926), the USA (1930), and Denmark (1932). These pavilions still dominate spatial experience at the main Biennale site, Giardini. More recent and/ or non-western pavilions may be found at the secondary site, Arsenale (Albania, Argentina, Chile, China, Ghana, just to begin the alphabet), and yet others in venues scattered through the city itself (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Cameroon ...). The older, longer-established European pavilions clearly chafe against their permanent, brick-and-mortar status. Spain's Ignasi Aballí, noticing that the Spanish pavilion is 10 degrees out of line with its neighbors, Belgium and Holland, builds new internal walls that create strange new, internal, off-kilter angles ('Correction,' 2022). Maria Eichorn, by way of rebelling against the fascist aesthetics of the 1938 rebuilt German pavilion, cuts deep trenches in the floor to uncover the simpler, more modest 1909 Ur-design. The USA covers its hard external brick with soft fronds, extending Simone Leigh's visionary Africanizing from her remaking of the interior space. Norway, Sweden, and Finland, who ordinarily share the Nordic Pavilion, give over their space to the Sámi, a people who traverse the space of all three nations; Holland, similarly, 'takes in' Estonia (and, by colonial extension, Indonesia). Poland and Greece afford space in their pavilions for the Roma people who inhabit their nations. Pessimism seems most marked within single, non-sharing European pavilions, with Denmark perhaps most depressing of all: a fabulous creature, a centaur, beautifully realized, is found hanging from the ceiling rafters by a rope around his neck. Chile's Hol-Hol Tol ('heart of peatlands'), at Arsenale, releases the voices of indigenous peoples, and their ancestors, from a much-loved environment. The positivity and colorful variety of South Africa's Into the Light is matched by Ghana's Black Star-- The Museum as Freedom. Here is the concluding part of curator Nana Oforiatta Ayim's introductory meditation:</p><blockquote>Within this constellation of countries at the Biennale, still the disadvantage of not being established, 'developed' enough, not having enough funds, funds falling through, not having systems, systems breaking down; scrambling to be part of this chorus of the world; at what cost, and to what end, the constant questioning refrain, and yet here we are, having crawled our way up the precipice, incomplete, forever late, and yet still in our own time, and here; nonetheless; black stars of the world, forever shining, forever </blockquote><p>The Biennale thus proves to be a wonderful place in which to meditate issues associated with our collective project. It will be open until 27 November 2022, and I warmly recommend making the trip to anyone with the means and good luck to do so. </p>"
